    <p>
      Flash is a lovley dog that was bron onto me on September 22, 2019. He is a a very sweet yet nervous puppy, as his
      mother was abused while she was pregnant. He has a strange tendency to smile (like above) when he get excited, and
      thats why he was named Flash after his smiles
